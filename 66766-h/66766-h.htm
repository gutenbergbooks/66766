<p>The first edition of the <a href="#SGW2"><cite>Report on Stained
Glass Windows for Grace Church, Lockport</cite></a>,
which appeared in January, 1897, is now
exhausted; as there is a constant demand
for it, a second is deemed necessary; and
the occasion seemed favorable for a little
further talk about Windows and Glass.
Hence this pamphlet.</p>

<p>The project of four years ago is no
longer an insubstantial dream. Since that
time eleven windows and three mosaics
have been placed in Grace Church; in
them all the adopted scheme has been
followed, with results more and more
obviously satisfactory.</p>

<p>Although intending this pamphlet, in
the first instance, simply for a guide to his
own people, to lead them to a more discriminating
appreciation: the author is
encouraged to hope, by many expressions
from the outside, that it will, even more
than the earlier <cite>Report</cite>, be of service beyond
his parish; that it may perhaps
stimulate elsewhere also a study of
Church Glass, and the erection of true
Church Windows.</p>

<p>The subject is certainly one of present
interest. The advertisements of firms
who produce stained glass windows are
numerous and conspicuous in our Church
weeklies; glowing accounts of memorials
just erected in this place and that make
up a large part of our “Diocesan News.”
To say nothing of the fact that we are in
danger of forgetting what the real business
of the Church is,—that it is not
primarily to build and beautify edifices,
but to save men and to establish righteousness
in the earth; the uncomfortable
question is forced upon us: For how
much of this “embellishment” of our
churches will posterity thank us?</p>

<p>A revival of religious art we welcome
with profound gratitude. But when for
the moment it threatens to take the form
of an epidemic of stained glass, our joy
may be turned to apprehension. Stained
glass is simply becoming fashionable;
everybody is beginning to want some of it
because ‘all the other churches are getting
some;’ commercial enterprise stimulates
a well-meaning zeal, taking advantage,
too, of a vulgar spirit of rivalry; and the
end thereof must be painful to contemplate.
Individuals are often given a free<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
hand in God’s House on the ground that
thus several hundred or several thousand
dollars will be secured for “enrichment;”
and so the work goes merrily on.</p>

<p>And such things can be because there
is a lack of knowledge. Persons may
have the best intention in the world;
their experience in other, different fields
may have been very wide; in a general
way they may have good taste; moreover,
they may possess a long purse and a liberal
disposition; perhaps they may think
to save themselves from going wrong by
putting the whole matter into the hands
of strongly advertised window-makers.
But none of these things will supply the
lack of a knowledge of stained glass.
There is nothing for it but study and
education. The clergy first of all, and
after them the vestries, must inform themselves
on the subject as thoroughly as
possible. In the meantime, let them be
slow to lend themselves to anything which
they later, or those who come after them,
might bitterly deplore and be helpless to
remedy.</p>

<p>Nor is it to-day so forbidding a task to
get this knowledge as it was but a few
years ago. Then one had to go to the
libraries in our largest cities, and laboriously
gather from rare works the history
and principles of this art. Now there is
fortunately at least one single volume,
easily obtainable, which may serve as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
text-book to all who desire to study the
subject. Mr. Lewis F. Day has given us
in his <cite>Windows: A Book about Stained
and Painted Glass</cite>, published in London,
1897, by B. T. Batsford, imported by
the Scribners, just that information which
is needed. No vestry that has the matter
of Stained Glass Memorials before it
should permit its rector to be without
this book; he should read, mark, learn,
and inwardly digest it; but not he only;
they also, at least the members of any
committee responsible for such work;
and intending donors likewise, who desire
to have a controlling voice in regard to
memorials to be erected. This is too important
a thing to enter upon recklessly
or at the dictation of mere fancy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile it may not be out of place
to tell briefly and simply what stained
glass windows in a church ought to be;
and what stained glass itself is.</p>

<p>Stained glass windows are still, after
all, windows: and windows are essential
component parts of a building. If in a
church, the axiom applies the more inevitably:
a church is a building presumed
to conform rigidly to a certain type; and
therefore, the idea which the whole is to
exhibit and impress must not for a moment
be hidden or dissipated by any
component part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>Our dwelling houses may be often built
in a haphazard way, with a view simply
to utility, regardless of style, laying no
claim to architectural art. But to build
a church so is an offense, an offense to
art, and, we believe, an offense to religion
also. A church building is presumed
and expected to have a certain character,
technically called “style,” dignifying
and elevating God’s House above our
common houses, even though it be small
and plain and not costly; small and plain
it may be, and not costly, but it must not
be tawdry or incongruous or mean.</p>

<p>Now a window is, as we have said, a
component part of the building. In a
church well conceived, the window is
inevitable just as it is: to make it larger
or smaller, to close one up where now
there is one or to make one where there
is none, is just so far to do violence to
the building. If such a change does not
violate the integrity of the building as a
whole, the fact simply goes to show that
the building had no plan worthy of honor.</p>

<p>The window-space is therefore always
to be preserved for window use—just
such and just so much as the architect
gave us. The use of a window (barring
for the moment the unscientific one of
ventilation) is to give light while still
affording shelter. And this light-space
is also to serve artistically as a kind of
balance to the dark space of the solid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
wall; hence this light-space is to art sacred,
and must be permitted to the end to
assert itself as just what it is and such as
it is, so much rightly apportioned and
correctly proportioned translucent wall-space.</p>

<p>When this window-space has been first
filled with a plain glass, which is then to
give way to stained glass, the new treatment
must say, just as obviously, only
more beautifully, what the old said: it
must still be a window—letting in light,
though now the light is colored—and in
its architectural value it must be just
what it was before, asserting the shape
and the design of the structural window,
plainly and faithfully.</p>

<p>In other words, the true stained glass
window—in a church building worthy of
that name—is not now to give the beholder
the impression that he is looking
out through an opening and seeing, of
something beyond, so much as the size
of the opening will permit: in a word,
the spectacular impression of looking into
some beautiful out-door world through a
hole in the wall. The beholder must be
conscious still of looking at the wall itself,
the translucent part of it, which
confines him within the edifice as much
as the stone or the brick. Nor yet is
the true stained glass window merely a
colored glass picture covering so much
wall area: the outline form is to be so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
obvious, and the treatment so non-realistic,
that the architectural idea may never
for a moment be in danger of submersion
under some other idea.</p>

<p>For, as is true in general of decorative
art as contrasted with pictorial art, the
true church window is to be designed
without perspective, without shadow,
without attempt at realistic effect. It is
to be conventional, symbolical; with that
intent it may utilize as it will forms,
colors, attitudes, postures, accessories,
fearless of the criticism that ‘this saint
or that scene never in the world looked
like that.’ No intelligent person standing
before decorative painting would for
a moment think of demanding a representation
of the actual. That, frankly,
was not its object.</p>

<p>And the stained glass church window
will further fulfill its particular end if all
round the figure or group, or whatever
be the subject matter of the composition,
there runs a clear line or border of differently
colored glass, making a clear demarcation
from the stone wall; drawing again,
as it were, the architect’s line of his window
construction.</p>

<p>All of which is but to say that windows
were made for the sake of the building,
and so must remain; not that a building
was made for the sake of windows,—for
the sake of furnishing so much space for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
so many square yards of somebody’s
beautiful glass. Which ought to be self-evident,
though to many persons it is not.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So regarding it now, the further question
naturally occurs as to the treatment
of the several windows of one particular
church. For, each individual window
might be in itself correct according to the
above principles, and yet the total effect
sadly lacking in unity and harmony.</p>

<p>There is first of all the consideration of
style: a difficult matter to define, yet not,
after all, so difficult to determine. What
ought certainly not to determine it is the
chance ability of some wealthy donor or
donors to pay for the costliest work that
could be produced; nor, on the other
hand, the limited ability of others who
could give only something inexpensive.
The style of the building and its general
character must determine the degree of
splendor and ornateness which will be
right for each and all the windows. If
there be wealth to do still more, then
exercise sober self-restraint. If there be
available means only to do part of what
the building demands, better do just so
much as can be rightly and adequately
done, though the scheme should wait
many years for its entire completion. In
building a new church, let this also be
thought of in advance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>Then there is the question of a single
scheme of subjects for all the windows,
so that all when completed shall tell,
chapter by chapter, one great story, or
part by part, one great truth: say, the
Christian Faith, or the Redemption of
Man, or the Sacramental Economy of
Grace, or the History of Religion, or the
Mission of the Church in the World.
Thus again, as in old time, will the church
windows instruct the people, and the sum
total of that instruction will be a unity,
with harmony and interrelation of parts,
of the utmost value to sound Christian
thinking and feeling, and to symmetry of
Christian character. For it is just this
which our modern religion so much lacks:
the sad result of sectarian thinking and
teaching, where each hath a doctrine, a
truth, and few the whole doctrine and
the wholeness of truth.</p>

<p>Individualism, let us realize, is not
what the Church should foster: though
individuality, in its rightful place, be
precious and sacred. The application
here is not fanciful. Sadly absurd examples
there are, where ecclesiastical art
has been pressed into service by sectarian
minds (not among the sects alone) to
teach some one portion or fragment of
truth through the eye every time the eye
gazed upon the interior of the house of
worship and fell upon the favorite symbol
or picture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>But not this alone. Individualism is
rampant in our day in the form of utterly
arbitrary choice of subjects, as well as
of their mode of treatment in point of
material, color, scale of drawing, and—expensiveness.
A Babel of confusion is
the result, and that in some of our
foremost churches, which have become
thereby rather picture galleries or museums
adapted to the study of all schools
and all tastes, than restful, devotional,
solemnizing and uplifting temples for the
worship of Almighty God. A low motive
ruled, and how can one help feeling
it as one looks upon the performance?—here
the wealthy donor, or the ambitious
so-called artist, forgetting Whose this
House was, demanded worship for himself.
“Verily, they have their reward.”</p>

<p>Therefore let those who have such
things in charge study first of all what a
church should be, and then what their
particular church, such as they have
received it in trust, is. It will often
be found that a building very little
esteemed has something to say for itself,
and is worthy of respect as originally
conceived, in its own structural character
as designed by its architect. And if not,
and if it must be borne with, then all the
more reason, in planning to do anything
further in it or upon it, to “abhor that
which is evil, and cleave to that which is
good.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>And after such careful study, determine
(before the first enthusiast has an
opportunity to put into some one window
chosen at random a “most superb”
production of the much advertised glass
man) determine in advance what should
be your total result when every window
shall have been filled with stained glass:
what story the whole shall tell, how best its
parts may be distributed, what each part
shall be, in what style, what design,
what scale of drawing, scheme of color.</p>

<p>And when this has been determined,
in the fear of God, in soberness of judgment,
in conscientious fidelity to a sacred
trust, with a willingness to be judged by
a wiser posterity,—then let such a plan
be adhered to as a law of the Medes and
Persians which altereth not. To sacrifice
one window to the seductions of some
alien grandeur is to sacrifice the whole
principle at stake. The plain glass patiently
awaiting its time to give way to
the right thing is more eloquent of a
truly reverent and truly artistic intention
than a medley of incongruous splendors.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now, what is stained glass? This
simple question it is of the utmost importance
to answer, because a little familiarity
with the materials and the methods
of workmanship will itself serve as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
guide to the choice of good windows and
to the avoidance of bad.</p>

<p>Stained glass, then, is simply glass
which has been colored in the pot, glass
which has its color within itself: while
painted glass—a term sometimes used as
synonymous with stained glass—is properly
glass which has had the color painted
upon its surface, and has then been fired
so that the colored or enameled surface
has been vitrified. Some stained glass
is of so deep a color,—red, for instance—that
a thin coating of it blown over the
surface of a white (that is, colorless)
glass is sufficient to produce the desired
color effect; if the entire thickness of the
pane were of the colored glass, the effect
would be much too dark: such glass is
nevertheless true stained glass, and is
called “flashed.”</p>

<p>In the early period of the art, beginning
in the eleventh century and running
parallel with the development of Pointed
(commonly called Gothic) Architecture,
only true stained glass was used. The
use of enamel paints applied to the surface
to produce a different color marks
also the beginning of the decadence of
the art; for the glory of true glass is in
its jewel-like quality, its color being
within itself and all absolutely translucent,
while a painted glass will always
be necessarily dull in comparison. The
temptation to paint color upon the surface<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
of glass is readily understood: it was an
easier method, it promised wider scope,
greater variety, in a word, the opportunity
to make pictures somewhat as the
painter may upon canvas. But glass is
not canvas, and church windows are not
to be pictures. Retribution has overtaken
this work, and the latest and most ambitious
more speedily than all; the enamel-painted
glass has not stood the test of
time, becoming muddy and perishing
while the true ancient stained glass is
still the joy and wonder of all who gaze
upon it.</p>

<p>For, as we have said, the glory of true
stained glass is in its rich, jewel-like
color. Its reds, which the makers called
“ruby,” its blues which they called
“sapphire,” with its “emerald” greens,
its “gold” and its “pearl,” never entered
the field to compete with the
achievements of the painter’s brush; to
compare the delight they afford the beholder
with that derived from a painting
would be in a sense as impossible as a
comparison between the fragrance of a
flower and the cadence of a song.</p>

<p>The early makers of stained glass windows
contended with great, to moderns
they would be intolerable, limitations.
They were almost absolutely restricted
to the primary colors. They had not at
first the art of blowing glass, but cast
their pieces in small panes of at most four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
or five inches in diameter. The use of
the diamond in cutting was not known
till the sixteenth century. Hence their
work was simply mosaic. For variety
they depended upon an arrangement of
geometrical patterns, or patterns of familiar
architectural form and of common
ecclesiastical symbols. To construct these
they leaded together their pieces and bits
of glass, elaborating their treatment as
time went on, but always in the main
upon the same lines.</p>

<p>When they began to portray, in panels
on their windows, the forms of Our Lord,
of His apostles, of saints and angels,
sometimes in crude settings of scenes or
incidents from Holy Scripture or Church
legend, their color principle was still the
same; and it was still the same in the
elaboration of the merely ornamental
borders with forms of leaf or flower or
fruit, or of sacred emblems and inscriptions.
The brown pigment with which
they produced faces and features, hands,
feet, outlines and ornamentations, was
not a color, nor intended for a color, but
simply a means of definition or delineation
when this was too minute to be carried
out with leads. And the stained
glass it was, still, which addressed the
eye and compelled attention and admiration.
No more than in heraldry did the
forms and emblems pretend to be pictures
of the actual, realistic representations of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
men, or of scenes or incidents. The
makers of early stained glass were, in
one word, simply makers of ornamental
windows of rich color and religious symbolism.</p>

<p>We have said that their pieces of glass
were small. This is but to say that their
windows were a network of leads. For
there is but one way to hold together
such pieces of glass in a window, and
that is by leads. These leads are not a
misfortune. A square yard of simple red
stained glass is artistically more beautiful
if composed of a hundred pieces leaded
together than if it were in a single sheet.
The differences in texture themselves
produce a better result, and the black
leads, scarcely discernible individually,
contribute an additional element of pleasure.
And in arranging pieces of different
color side by side, intelligent leading
design was itself the artist’s drawing,
and effected results altogether admirable.
So far was this art of leading carried in
France, for instance, that windows mainly
of white glass were produced, of rare
beauty by simple virtue of their structural
design.</p>

<p>All this was changed by the men who
in a later age ground up their enamel
pigments, glazed windows in large panes,
and daubed upon them their muddy
colors, with a sublime contempt for the
crude laborious mosaic work of their predecessors.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
Would they have a representation
of the earth for their figure to stand
upon? it must be carpeted with grass,
with green grass, and they can paint
green grass upon a colorless surface; red
flowers also, upon the same, with red paint,
if such were desired. The Renaissance
was coming; Gothic was barbarous anyway;
antiquated crudities must give place
to refined work worthy of the new enlightenment!
Paint a picture on canvas,
then paint that picture on your glass. It
can be done, certainly, if you will not
allow yourself to be bothered with the
nuisance of leads, but just get an ample
pane of glass, unobstructed, and go at it
with your brush and paints!</p>

<p>This miserable travesty did not long
hold sway, it was scarcely permitted to
go its own theoretical length. There
came great political changes, great religious
changes, and for a long time few
churches more were built, nor even those
standing kept in repair. The course of
Ecclesiastical Architecture suffered an
interruption for several centuries, of
which Mr. Ralph Adams Cram has told
us feelingly in his recent writings on that
subject.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But within the memory of men now
living there has also come the beginning
of a true revival. The awakening of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
Catholic spirit in the Anglican Communion
has been accompanied by an eager desire
to recover lost treasures and to restore
sound traditions to their former
honor.</p>

<p>And naturally all this has shown itself
in the cultivation of Stained Glass also.
As we have said, what is needed above
all else is knowledge, to guide us to what
is really good and worthy.</p>

<p>No sooner is any want of the public
made evident than enterprising trade
springs up to supply that want. If you
want colored church windows, you can
have them to-day at a trifle per square
yard by purchasing a beautifully printed
paper, of genuine ecclesiastical design,
and pasting it upon your present windows.
From this most abysmal horror
of vulgarity you may pass through various
successive gradations of so-called
stained glass, all supplied by trade. If
you pass on to the costliest, you are not
thereby sure to obtain what is not horrible
and vulgar, when regarded from the
point of view of true Stained Glass, of
Architectural Art, and of Religion.</p>

<p>There are at this moment three rather
diverse schools of Stained Glass most in
evidence before those who seek and are
willing to pay for honest art work; the
English, the German, and the American.
Their comparative merits are nowhere, to
our knowledge, presented in a fair minded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
way; the makers of each claim superior
excellence for their own, of course; if,
indeed, they ever intimate to the public
that there is any other kind at all. It
should be said, however, that there is
great merit in the best examples of each
school; and that none of these schools
can fairly be judged by the inferior stuff
which is put out under its name, for each
of them is defamed by such stuff.</p>

<p>The English school naturally had, and
still has, great prestige among Churchmen.
Taking it at its best, as for instance
in the work of Mr. Henry Holiday, it is
simple and vigorous in drawing, varied
and harmonious in color, churchly in
spirit, while free from mediævalism.
The English artist believes in stained
glass, glass which has its color within
itself; and good glass, the best he can
obtain. His glass is flat, that is, of even
surface and equal thickness. He believes
in painting upon this glass, and upon,
one may say, every piece and bit of it;
but he does not paint a color upon it, he
simply shades it, draws folds of drapery,
patterns of fabrics, details of ornamentations;
always, however, aiming to leave
it, however much so painted, with the
color of the glass gleaming and glittering:
that is, he does not daub over the
surface, but puts on mere lines, and picks
out lights, so that his painted piece of
green glass, let us say, is still green glass,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
only with design upon it, or texture, or
light and shade. He feels that only in
this way has he done all which as an
artist he is conscientiously bound to do;
and he accounts a piece of mere stained
glass which has not felt the brush at all,
which has not had the touch of the conscious
art of the maker, a poor thing, in
a sort, crude and barbaric.</p>

<p>In the hands of a master—and there
have been great masters in the English
school—the results of this method have
been very fine. But even so the fact remains
that every line and every particle
of even neutral pigment upon the surface
of glass obscures so much light; which is
to say, it detracts so much from its brilliancy
and splendor. The fact is undeniable
that the total effect of some great
window of this school will be charming,
but withal just a little dull; the richness
which gleams and glitters from it is yet
half hidden as by some fluttering veil before
it. Such work at its best is exquisite;
it is devotional; it is soothing; but hardly
gives one a thrill of gladness. In the
hands of a master, it is a fit medium for
strong individuality of a good kind, as
witness Burne-Jones’ windows executed
at the works of William Morris. In the
hands of the common multitude of English
makers, it degenerates into a wearisome,
conventional repetition of stiff
figures, draped in the same damask stuffs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
with the same wooden little flowers growing
up around their feet, the whole surrounded
by the same easily managed
conventional border.</p>

<p>Of the German glass, commonly called
Munich glass, it is sufficient for our purpose
to say that it is in principle the same
as the English. It relies much upon the
brush. It is more in the mediæval spirit
than the English; its feeling is that of a
simply traditional, not a modern, devoutness.
Its inspiration is Italian. Its colors
are more predominatingly the old primary
colors. Its decorative features are strictly
conventional, and applied in a mechanical
spirit. In warmth, in splendor of
color, German windows at their best are
superior to the English.</p>

<p>American glass is not simply glass
made in America. The term denotes a
new method, which yet is, in the main, a
restoration of the very oldest method, reinforced
on its own lines by modern resources.
Mr. John La Farge is its distinguished
pioneer.</p>

<p>American glass is true stained glass;
but it is not glass of even surface and of
equal thickness.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> By its inequality of
thickness the American artist effects
what the English artist accomplishes by
brushing dark lines upon his even glass;
or he leads strips and pieces of glass on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
the back of his window to intensify and
deepen his color, as in folds of drapery
and the like. He paints nothing except
faces, hands and feet; all the rest he
binds himself to obtain by the mosaic
method. He cannot obtain by the mosaic
method everything that the English artist
obtains by the brush; but he feels that
he obtains all which in a window is
necessary, and by patient, thoroughly
artistic work he obtains what upon study
proves marvelous; and he has all his
glass free to exhibit the full glory of
glass. His very necessities compel him
to compose in the true way, that is by
lead lines; he is back upon first principles
in this respect. The lead lines mark
the structural lines of his drawing. But
he has still to contend with the necessity
of painting his flesh parts; and of overcoming
the break between their flatness,
between the dull hardness of painted faces,
hands and feet, and the splendid jewel-like
strength of all the rest of his window.
The best he can do is to make this
transition as little abrupt as possible.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[A]</a> The earliest glass was not glass of even surface
and equal thickness. Therein lies one of its charms.</p>

</div>

<p>Needless to say, the American school
has its dangers. The ease with which an
ignorant eye may be imposed upon by
great pieces of folded glass instead of
conscientiously selected and leaded strips
and pieces, is a snare, into which it is not
necessary for an honest artist to fall.
When, however, a customer demands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
something cheap, he can obtain it in so-called
American glass, and it will be
cheap enough. There has been also a
deplorable tendency among some prominent
American glass makers toward startling
theatrical effects. Of unchurchly
windows, windows hopelessly and utterly
unchurchly, the great majority doubtless
are of the American school; nor are they
the windows which have cost the least
money. Novel and indescribable colors,
as far removed as possible from all sober,
reverent, devotional feeling, have been
employed; effects have been sought which
actually destroy all the value of the window
as what it was designed by its architect,
a window in a sacred edifice. And
by the wide heralding of such performances,
as if American glass meant simply
this sort of thing, American glass has
forfeited that just appreciation which in
its essential principles it so richly merits.
Let the American school remember that a
window in a church is and forever must
remain just a window, subservient that
is, to the architecture of the church; let
it design in the spirit of worshipful, reverent,
dignified, sober devotion; let it
compose with technical conscientiousness
and love its leads and spare no labor; let
it choose thoroughly good glass, and
glass of predominantly the glorious colors
so long honorable, eschewing startling
and meretricious effects: and there will,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
to our mind, be no doubt of its being the
Stained Glass of the future.</p>

<p>But, to our thinking, one thing cannot
safely be done; and that is the placing of
English and American, or Munich and
American glass side by side in the same
building. Let it be the one or the other;
when you have chosen which it shall be,
adhere to that. To mingle the schools
in the same edifice will be sure to prove
fatal to the best effects of each.</p>

<p>And before placing any permanent
stained glass, again let us say, study the
subject; see all the windows you can;
and make haste slowly.</p>

<small>For Grace Church, Lockport.</small></h2>

<p class="noi author">A Report to the Vestry of the Parish by
its Rector, January 5, 1897.</p>
</div>


<p class="p2">After many months of inquiry, reflection,
special study, and such visits to churches as opportunity
afforded, we are at last in a position
to bring together the facts bearing upon this
important project, and to submit the results for
your consideration.</p>

<p>Grace Church,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> Lockport, is an edifice which
though not striking or ornate, is in point of
architectural merit, of conspicuous importance
in the community, in probable permanence and
enduring interest second to none in our city.
Erected more than forty years ago, of stone, its
interior chastely beautified and enriched at successive
periods; its nave alone over one hundred
feet long, forty-six feet wide, fifty feet high; its
lofty chancel with a window twenty-two feet in
height, nearly ten feet in width: it impresses the
educated eye on entering it as beautiful and
churchly, characterized by simple grace and
reverent dignity, and the exclusion of the tawdry
and incongruous. We may honestly admit some
faults. What building, religious or other, is
without them? But it is a church which grows
upon us the longer we worship in it; it becomes
homelike to us, and yet excites our admiration
the more as we become better acquainted with it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[B]</a> The design was one of Richard Upjohn’s.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>This is the building which is committed to
our care. Not only that we keep it clean and
in repair, warmed and lighted, not only that we
preserve the fabric as a valuable piece of property;
but that continuing to labor in the spirit
of those who have preceded us, we secure such
further additions to it as will tend to make it
complete in its kind.</p>

<p>We say, complete in its kind. And it is our
sacred duty, therefore, to understand what it is
that we already have, as well as to ask what
further gifts and further embellishments might
add thereto. For to add, with the best intention
and with lavish generosity, but without an understanding
of the conditions and limitations
imposed by the existing edifice, might easily
result in such disastrous incongruity as a future
generation, if not ours, would deplore. The
land is full of warning examples, and one is at
times appalled to think of the vast sums embodied
in worse than waste, from which our better
educated descendants after us will suffer in the
years to come. Knowledge is bound to grow;
travel and study cannot fail to make an understanding
of these things the common property
of intelligent Church people as time goes on.
And it is a grave responsibility to be at the head
of a parish in which permanent work is undertaken
and executed, work on which the future
is to pronounce judgment. This responsibility,
let me add, your rector for one feels very seriously
and deeply.</p>

<p>A very common form of architectural enrichment
in this day of growing wealth and of
increasing commemoration of the departed is
that of stained glass windows. No memorial
can be more beautiful than this when wisely
planned and well executed. None can be much
more painful or incessantly offensive when
inartistic, incongruous, or lacking in the true
devotional spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>And as touching our own case, it is reasonably
certain that offers will be made to place such
windows in Grace Church. It would be ungenerous
to decline them. Moreover, we cannot
escape the moral obligation of directing what
such memorials shall be, so far as the building
itself, its style of architecture, its uses, and its
history, shall impose the conditions. It is not
a question of dictating to intending donors: for
the vestry to decline to exercise such control
would be for us to fail of a sacred trust.</p>

<p>Our church, we may be most thankful to bear
in mind, is built in a style pure and self-consistent,
plain as it is. It is Early English, of
the first and simplest of the periods of Gothic.
To treat it as if it were of some other style, in any
changes or additions we might see fit to make
hereafter, would be to do violence to the edifice,
to wrong its intelligent and loving builders in
the days of good Bishop De Lancey, and those
who shall inherit it after we are gone. There is
meaning and purpose in it, as it is: in every line
of it, in every arch, every dimension, every
grouping and distribution of parts.</p>

<p>We are not at liberty, therefore, to change the
window openings, in size or form, unless indeed
we wish to rebuild the church. We may at our
taste reconstruct the windows in the houses in
which we live, but we cannot alter the style of
these windows without destroying the style of the
architecture. The series of long narrow lancets,
no matter how long or how narrow, are right;
and with all their severe simplicity, their beauty
of outline and their grace and dignity grow upon
one the more they are studied. Mediæval builders
had a meaning even in putting such windows
in pairs; it may seem to us a little fantastic, but
as they made everything symbolical, so in this
grouping they symbolized our Lord’s sending
out His Apostles two and two. Apart from such
a consideration, there is a quiet grace in this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
long succession of lancet pairs which may safely
be left to speak for itself.</p>

<p>The development of window forms is itself
very interesting, and should be understood before
an attempt is made to treat any church
windows in particular. Mrs. Van Rensselaer,
who has done so much to make the English
cathedrals known in this country, thus traces
the successive steps from style to style: “Fancy
first a plain tall window with a round-arched
head; then the round exchanged for a pointed
head; then two, or three, or five perhaps, of
these pointed windows set close together; and
then a projecting moulding in the shape of an
arch drawn around them, including them all
and thus including, of necessity, a plain piece
of wall above their heads. Then fancy this
piece of wall pierced with a few small openings,
and we have a group of connected lights in
which, as a plant in its embryo, lies the promise
of all after-development....</p>

<p>“The small lights in the upper field enlarge
and multiply until they form a connected pattern
which fills its whole area, and the jambs of the
main lights diminish into narrow strips or very
slender columns. The great arch, which in the
first place did but encircle the windows, thus
becomes itself the window—the ‘plate-traceried’
window which was richly developed in early
French Gothic, but less richly in English, owing
to the persistent local love for mere groups of
lancets. Then all the stone-work shrinks still
farther—the columnar character of the uprights
is lost, and the flat surfaces between the upper
openings change into mouldings of complex
section. Thus the original tall lights and upper
piercings surrender their last claim to independence;
the uprights are no longer jambs or bits
of wall but mullions, the arch-head is filled
with genuine traceries, and all the elements of
the design are vitally fused together within the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
sweep of the great window to form its multiple
yet organic beauty.”</p>

<p>The art of making stained glass windows went
hand in hand with this development of architectural
forms through the eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth
and succeeding centuries. It has indeed
been called the “principal branch of Mediæval
Art;” but was always treated as absolutely subservient
to the particular architecture itself. A
most eminent authority denies that the art of
glass-staining has ever been lost. Glass itself
was used by Christians in their churches from
the earliest church-building times; the distinct
art of painting on glass emerges, one might say,
with the springing up of pointed architecture,
though the beginnings show themselves in Norman
architecture in the eleventh century. Four
centuries the two arts flourished side by side;
with the decadence of the greater came also the
decline of the subsidiary; a poorer taste in building
was naturally accompanied by a poorer taste
in glass. With the revival of interest in those
long-neglected periods of noble achievement,
the Oxford movement of Church Restoration
giving men the religious guiding principles for
an intelligent appreciation of the forms of
Mediæval art, church building and glass staining
were brought back again, the one with the
other. And whether such restoration can leave
us satisfied with the mere recovery of the riches
of by-gone ages, or must mean also, as I believe,
the development of what the present can contribute
in a reverent but not slavish spirit—certain
it is that the first step is to understand the
past, to find out what was done in the great
formative and classic periods, why it was done
as it was and not otherwise, in a word, to master
the models before we proceed on our own course;
and, as I said before, to remember to which
period and style our own edifice belongs.</p>

<p>It was my good fortune when recently in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
city of Philadelphia, to obtain access to a
rare work over which I spent some very
delightful hours. Its author was a William
Warrington, himself a designer and producer of
windows, and a reverent student of ancient examples,
who published his great folio in London,
in 1848. From him I learned many things about
the beginnings and progress of the art. Great
were the difficulties of the eleventh century
pioneers. They had to contend with defective
methods of manufacture; not understanding
glass-blowing they fused their glass in pots and
crucibles, and cast it to about the required shape,
in pieces not more than four or five inches in
diameter. Cutting with the diamond was not
known till the sixteenth century. They designed
and made and erected their own work. When
great orders were to be executed, artists were
brought together from the different countries,
and by a sort of “free-masonry” they worked
together in perfect agreement as to styles, rules,
and principles.</p>

<p>In the course of time, different countries produced
slightly differing schools.</p>

<p>As in heraldry, the colors of the glass were
intended for colors of precious stones; the representations
of figures and objects were not meant
to be pictures, but being also strictly symbolical,
the drawing was conventional, with no intention
to reproduce nature in color, or form, or position
and perspective. The figures which excite ridicule
on the part of one who is without the clue,
justify themselves by this principle; nor is it
quite true to say the men of that time did not
know how to draw—their ability in this respect
was not that of artists to-day, but if their object
had been to produce a figure or a scene for the
sole purpose of a picture, they might certainly
and would certainly have given us something
very different from what they did. While the
small separate pieces are often very minutely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
pencilled, all such work being afterward burned
in—there is no “shadowing,” as in a picture,
supposing the light to fall from a certain direction;
but a kind of “relief” shading, making
the view suitable to any aspect. In a word, the
drawing is the same as in MSS., tapestries and
heraldic designs. Ruby and sapphire were the
ground colors. And in all the work the primitive
colors were adhered to.</p>

<p>In York Minister there is to be found the
largest and finest specimen of thirteenth century
glass in England in a group of lancets known as
the “Five Sisters.” The lancets are each six
feet wide and fifty feet high, and each divided
into thirteen compartments or squares of different
patterns. Their designs being largely of an
ornamental character, they escaped destruction
by the Puritans.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that English stained glass
at no time had large figures. In the thirteenth
century Continental art in this respect diverged
from ancient and English, under Italian influence.</p>

<p>In the Cathedral of Bourges there are one
hundred and eighty-three stained glass windows,
executed from the thirteenth century downwards.
The early lancets have figures occupying
the larger part of the window, sometimes fifteen
or twenty feet high; over each figure a sort of
canopy or tabernacle disproportionately small,
and under it a kind of pedestal or base about a
foot high. Around the margin is the finest work
in the windows, in a broad band of mosaic.</p>

<p>Cologne Cathedral has four lancets each eleven
times its width in height, filled with early glass
of this period; the figures in the windows are in
height one-third the height of the lancet, with a
canopy above them.</p>

<p>The developments of the centuries following
are of less interest to our present purpose. Suffice
it to say that even in the rich Decorated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
Style of Architecture the treatment of individual
windows was not what we might term ambitious:
the effect was secured by not attempting too
much in a single window, but by producing a
rich harmony with subordination of each to the
whole. In the Perpendicular Style which followed,
in the fifteenth century, while there was
a very abundant production of glass, its quality
was inferior, and much white glass was used.
Figures with canopies were used when the single
openings were one foot wide and upward; panels,
when they were considerably larger; and to fill
the extreme length, story upon story. And
there begins to appear a tendency to conform
the glass less to the architecture itself.</p>

<p>From the sixteenth century on there is marked
decay. The attempts to treat glass like canvas
prove an entire failure. A voluptuous and sensual
school of painting came in, debasing a
religious art, which thus became secularized,
and almost disappeared. The destruction of fine
ancient examples in the Puritan revolution left
England very poor, and the little that remained
came to be less and less appreciated.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, large importations of glass
consequent on the French Revolution with its
destruction of churches, put into the hands of
English churchmen what the religious revival
of the Church soon taught them to appreciate
once more, and so it is that to-day England is
enriching her cathedrals and churches with restorations
and new windows; and from her the
impulse has naturally come to our own land also.
But the production of stained glass is in America
of very recent date.</p>

<p>From facts like the foregoing we may conclude
that the subject is one of importance and involving
so much that it is well that we should proceed
cautiously in the placing of stained glass
in Grace Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>But shall we encourage such a movement at
all?</p>

<p>It seems to me that this is the moment supremely
opportune for us to inaugurate a scheme
of window treatment such as shall glorify our
house of God more and more till it reaches completion.
How long it may take to reach completion
is in a sense immaterial. That we should
begin now, and make every step a right one, is
the great matter.</p>

<p>The practical question is, Shall we choose to
admit one or a few striking windows into this
edifice, windows which may have no relation to
each other, produced possibly by methods or on
principles entirely at variance, in color-schemes
discordant, in scale of drawing entirely dissimilar
and unequal: or shall we guide intending donors
to such gifts as shall be a satisfaction and a delight
forever, beautiful each in itself, but more
beautiful still when assembled? This I take it
is the question. For I believe windows will be
placed, whether we encourage it or not, within a
decade, possibly much sooner. And when I put
the question thus, it appears to me there is but
one answer possible.</p>

<p>Let us then get down to the practical details in
the matter. Leaving the great chancel window
entirely out of consideration, we have five pairs
of lancets of equal size on either side of the nave,
and a sixth, smaller pair over the doors in continuation
of the series up to the chancel. We
have further, the magnificent group of three
lancets at the foot of the nave, with a fourth
lancet a little smaller, and still much larger than
those in the pairs already referred to.</p>

<p>Here is a considerable number of windows—twenty-nine
when we count in the chancel window;
what an opportunity for discord and artistic
anarchy! Let us say, rather, what a remarkable
and rare opportunity for the production of
a rich and hallowed splendor, fitted not only to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
express the consecration of man’s gifts to God,
but to instruct the minds and quicken the devotions
of generations to come.</p>

<p>The objection which most readily offers itself
when stained glass is proposed for Grace Church
is that the twenty lancets at the sides are so extremely
narrow and so very high that nothing
can be done with them. If by ‘doing something’
is meant putting in scenes with several or many
figures, it is most true. The breadth of wall
between the two windows constituting the pair
is so large that the scene could not be carried
from the one to the other. But surely that does
not exhaust the possibilities. The openings are
wide enough to permit the treatment of single
figures in full life-size if desired; figures with
canopies, borders, and panels at the base, as in
the best periods of ancient glass. The breadth
of these openings is twenty-one inches; six
inches more than that of the small pair erected
All Saints, 1895, at the side of the pulpit, in
which the figures are certainly of dignified stature,
and by no means poor in back ground and
accessories. If such results are possible in a
space fifteen inches wide and six feet high; how
much more in a space twenty-one inches wide
and thirteen feet high.</p>

<p>Single figures, therefore, are demanded by
the conditions which govern us, for the side
lancets; unless we rest content with geometrical,
or flower windows, or windows bearing emblems,
more or less ornately bordered. I venture to
say that at this stage of our history, when we
are not pressed to fill our window-openings with
whatever may be obtainable, we desire the best
that can be had. This best, for the side lancets
is,—single figures, with canopy, border and base
panel.</p>

<p>Mr. F. S. Lamb of New York, who designed
the beautiful work erected a year ago, has prepared
and sent me two pairs of colored sketches,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
suggesting a noble and beautiful form which in
the execution would, of course, far surpass what
appears in the drawings. They are submitted
for your careful study, and may be seen at any
time in my library.</p>

<p>What then shall the figures be? Shall they
be chosen at random? Artistically speaking,
this might not be so disastrous, provided the
same artist drew all the designs and controlled
the execution, so that the scale of drawing and
the scheme of color were kept in accord. And
that is a great deal more than can be said of
some of the principal churches in our greatest
cities, where immense sums have been spent on
these works. No; there is something better
still, open to us. It is a serial treatment, with
unity, and progress: so that the whole, when
complete, shall tell one great story, each part a
chapter therein; the whole impress one truth,
each part contributing somewhat to the cumulative
force of the great lesson.</p>

<p>And, not to detain you with all the processes
of thought and long reflection by which at last
we reach our conclusion—the figures we suggest
are those which are conspicuous and representative
in the Old and New Testaments. Our
Divine Lord Himself should be, as He is, exalted
in the great window over the altar. Beginning
from the angle of the chancel arch to pass
around the church, we come first to the pair of
small windows next to the organ, from which
now the light is excluded by the parish building.
They may be taken as in a sense going with the
organ, and scarcely a part of the general scheme.
Let them be treated, at some time, in mosaic,
with <span class="smcap">Singing Angels</span>,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> thus corresponding to
the Angels directly opposite in the corresponding
small windows. Then we pass to the first
pair of lancets of uniform size, <span class="smcap">Melchizedek</span>
and <span class="smcap">Abraham</span>: the latter the great father of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
faithful, the head of the covenant people; the
former even superior to him, a priest forever,
without beginning or end of days, type of our
Lord’s own Highpriesthood. Melchizedek appears
before Abraham, bearing bread and wine,
foreshadowing of the Holy Eucharist. What
more suitable, as we look up to the altar and see
above it the figure of Our Blessed Lord, than to
turn to the head of the nave, and find here, at
the dawn of religious history, standing out as
type of the Christ in whom the course of the
ages shall culminate, this King of Salem at the
very beginning?</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[C]</a> Recently placed.</p>

</div>

<p>We pass on. The next pair will be <span class="smcap">Moses</span>
and <span class="smcap">Samuel</span>: both conspicuous as appointed of
God to lead, to rule, to judge the people whom
God had chosen; Founders of Israel as a nation.
Surely these, if any, we must commemorate as
among the greatest in the covenant history.</p>

<p>This brings us to the third or middle pair.
Woman, too, bears her conspicuous part in the
spiritual history of mankind. <span class="smcap">Deborah</span><a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>
judged Israel for forty years in a period of disorder
and confusion, and led the way to victory:
<span class="smcap">Ruth</span>,<a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> a very different type, beautiful and
gentle, became one of that line of whom David,
and David’s Greater Son, were born. Other
women might have been chosen, as well as other
men; but on the whole, none more typical, none
better fitted to instruct and to impress.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[D]</a> Now in place.</p>

</div>

<p>The fourth pair continues the narrative.
<span class="smcap">David</span> and <span class="smcap">Elijah</span>, each so striking in his way,
bring back the kingdom in its glory and the
kingdom in its disaster; religion sweetly ministrant
with music, and religion sternly denouncing
national sin; the royal harp, and the prophetic
mantle.</p>

<p>And finally, the fifth pair on this side, <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>
and <span class="smcap">Malachi</span>: the greatest of all the prophets,
called the Evangelist of the Old Testament; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
the last of seers, who most clearly foretold both
Messiah and Forerunner.</p>

<p>Thus we arrive at one of the entrances, and
turning the corner, we stand before the first of
the windows at the lower end. It is large enough
to admit more than one figure. It continues
the story from Malachi, to him who went before
the face of the Lord: it presents to us <span class="smcap">St. John
The Baptist</span>,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> baptizing at Jordan; and close
by it stands the Font with its summons, as of
old, to the washing away of sins.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[E]</a> To be erected in the near future.</p>

</div>

<p>A splendid opportunity is presented by the
great group next in order, the three associated
windows piercing the end wall of the nave.
Majestic in their simple dignity of outline, what
will they not be when filled with stained glass as
they should be? Here is space, indeed—ample
room for that scene treatment of which the side-wall
windows are incapable.</p>

<p>Let the middle one, which is much the largest,
be the <span class="smcap">Nativity</span>;<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> that on the right side
(next to St. John Baptist) the <span class="smcap">Presentation
in the Temple</span>,<a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> with Simeon’s Nunc Dimittis;
that on the left side, the <span class="smcap">Epiphany</span>,<a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> with the
Gifts of the Magi. Thus will this entire end-wall
set forth the Incarnation, up to which the
Old Testament has led us, and out of which proceeds
the New, and all the history of the Christian
Church.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[F]</a> Now in place.</p>

</div>

<p>Turning again, and passing on, back once
more toward the chancel, the first and second
pairs of lancets on the Cottage Street side are
devoted to the four Evangelists, <span class="smcap">Sts. Matthew</span>,
<span class="smcap">Mark</span>, <span class="smcap">Luke</span> and <span class="smcap">John</span>. No explanation is
needed of the propriety of putting these figures
here. Not only as the biographers of the Lord
Jesus Christ, but as chief Founders of that
Church which is builded upon Historic Facts—men
of deeds as well as writers—we commemorate
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>The middle pair is again given to two great
women of the New Testament, mothers both
and as mothers supremely great: <span class="smcap">St. Elizabeth</span><a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a>
and <span class="smcap">St. Mary</span>.<a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> Of the son of the first
one it was said, Among those born of women
there hath not appeared a greater than John. To
the other the Angel’s word was, Hail, thou that
are highly favored: the Lord is with thee; and
blessed art thou among women. No two characters
can lay more claim to our gratitude and
reverence than these two women to whom an
Allwise God entrusted the tender formative
years of the Forerunner and of the Messiah.</p>

<p>There is indeed a glorious company of
Apostles, and a noble army of martyrs, whom
one would gladly set forth, two and two, in
goodly succession. Two pairs must suffice us:
first <span class="smcap">St. Andrew</span><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> and <span class="smcap">St. Stephen</span>;<a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> next <span class="smcap">St.
Peter</span><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> and <span class="smcap">St. Paul</span>.<a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> We begin with <span class="smcap">St.
Andrew</span>, for he readily obeyed the calling of
Christ and followed Him without delay, bringing
his brother also: type of self-devotion and
personal service, forever. <span class="smcap">St. Stephen</span>, set
apart for the Church’s charitable work, filled
with the Holy Ghost and a mighty preacher,—he
was the first Deacon, and became the first
Martyr. <span class="smcap">St. Peter</span> and <span class="smcap">St. Paul</span> bring us to a
climax in the Church’s realization of the great
commission; prince apostles, the former first
led to the Gentiles but afterward distinctly
charged with the Gospel to the Circumcision;
the latter sent out to the Uncircumcision, truest
champion of a Catholic Faith and uncompromising
leader of a Catholic Church. He brings us,
as we pass the two Angel figures over the door,
up to the pulpit,—who fitter than he to be set
always before the preacher?—and thence again
we see before us the altar and the figure of Our
Blessed Lord from which we started on our circuit;</p>

<p>This is the scheme which is hereby recommended
to your attentive consideration, your
criticism, and if worthy, your adoption. When
adopted, each opening will be available only for
the subject assigned to it, treated in the best
style, under the direction and approval of the
vestry. Windows may be erected in any order,
provided these conditions are complied with;
though it is highly desirable that not less than a
pair—where there are pairs—should be placed at
a time. It is immaterial how many persons join
in donating a window. The use of the windows
for memorials is very beautiful and very desirable;
but there is no restriction to such use, by
anything in the scheme.</p>

<p>And in closing let it be added, that if—as
undoubtedly they will—the vestry and
parish shall feel sincerely thankful to those
who participate in this pious work, it is not
there that the gratitude should chiefly lie. It is
an unspeakable privilege to be permitted to
place a memorial like this in the house of God,
bringing ever new comfort and joy to hearts
bereaved, and satisfaction to the donors; yes, if
there is need to say it, it is an honor to be permitted
to do it. Moreover, in the nature of the
case, it is a privilege very limited as to the number
of those who can be so favored; and with
every window that is taken, the number remaining
available becomes rapidly less.</p>

<p>The above Report with its Recommendations
was adopted, entire, by unanimous vote of the
Vestry at the regular monthly meeting, January

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
